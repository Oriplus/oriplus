### Hi there üëã I'm Oriana

I'm a web developer, I had worked with technologies such as PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js. I'm on the road to becoming a web3 developer and contributing to the Blockchain ecosystem.

Currently, I'm working as a PHP developer and I'm part of the Ethereum Developer Program at Platzi where We're building amazing projects.

### [Magic Pets](https://github.com/Oriplus/magic-pets-interface)

Magic Pets is a dynamic collection of NFTs to raise funds for a fictional foundation. At first, the NFT is an egg that has a surprise in it, then when people buy they will receive a pet. It also works with control access to create an NFT.
