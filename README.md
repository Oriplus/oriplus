### Hi there 👋 I'm Oriana

I'm a web developer, I had worked with technologies such as PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js. I'm on the road to becoming a web3 developer and contributing to the Blockchain ecosystem.

Currently, I'm working as a PHP developer and I'm part of the Ethereum Developer Program at Platzi where We're building amazing projects.

### 🎯 Some technologies I use:
